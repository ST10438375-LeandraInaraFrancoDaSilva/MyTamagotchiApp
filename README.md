Tamagotchi App

Readme

This app promotes virtual interactivity between people and a virtual pet, presenting a less stressful way of taking care of an animal. 

To get started you first should press the get started button that will lead you to a secondary page where interactions actually take place. Once on the page you should press the buttons that correspond to the activities so that the status on that increase and you can give a look to the pet executing the action for a short amount of time. 

In case you want to redo the actions just click on the refresh button and all the data there should be clear, if you aim to give a look back to the main page you are free to do so by pressing the restart button.
All the activities in the app can be played in a loop, how many times you desire.
